Tuple is an ordered, immutable sequence in Python
1. Ordered (keeps the original order)
2. Immutable (cannot modify after creation)
3. Can contain mixed data types
4. Faster than lists
5. Can be used as dictionary keys (lists cannot)

``` python
# Basic Tuple
t = (1,2,3)
t = (1, "hello", 3.5, (4,5))   
t = 1, 2, 3  # Parentheses are optional
t = ()       # Empty tuple
t = (5,)     # Single element tuple (note the comma)

# Accessing Tuple Elements
t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(t[0])    # 10
print(t[3])    # 40
print(t[-1])   # 50
print(t[-3])   # 30

# Immutability
t = (1, 2, 3)
# t[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError
# However, you can create a new tuple by concatenation
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = t1 + (4, 5)
print(t2)  # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)


# Tuple Methods
t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)
print(t.count(2))   # 3 (counts occurrences of 2)
print(t.index(3))   # 2 (index of first occurrence of 3)

# Tuple Unpacking
t = (10, 20, 30)
a, b, c = t
print(a)  # 10
print(b)  # 20
print(c)  # 30

# Nested Tuples
t = (1, (2, 3), (4, 5, 6))
print(t[1])      # (2, 3)
print(t[1][0])   # 2
print(t[2][2])   # 6

# Tuple as Dictionary Keys
my_dict = { (1, 2): "Point A", (3, 4): "Point B" }
print(my_dict[(1, 2)])  # Point A

# Tuple Functions
t = (5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6)
print(len(t))        # 6
print(min(t))        # 1
print(max(t))        # 9
print(sorted(t))     # [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]

# Converting List to Tuple
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
t = tuple(lst)
print(t)  # (1, 2, 3, 4)
# Converting Tuple to List
t = (1, 2, 3, 4)
lst = list(t)
print(lst)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# When to use Tuples instead of Lists
# 1. When the data should not change (immutability)
# 2. When you need a faster data structure
# 3. When you need to use the data as dictionary keys

# Looping through a Tuple
t = (10, 20, 30, 40)
for item in t:
    print(item)
# Tuple Slicing
# How does tuple slicing work in Python?
# Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a tuple by specifying a start index, an end index, and an optional step.
# The syntax for slicing is: tuple[start:end:step]
```

t = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
print(t[2:5])    # (2, 3, 4)
print(t[:4])     # (0, 1, 2, 3)
print(t[5:])     # (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
print(t[::2])   # (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
