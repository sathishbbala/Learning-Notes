A set in Python:
1. Unordered (no index, no position)
2. Mutable ( you can add/remove)
3. Unique items only (Duplicates are automatically removed)
4. Super fast for membership checks (in operator)
``` python
# How to create a set

# Adding items

# Removing items 

# Membership Test

# Mathematical operations sets support mathematical operations like Union and Intersection
# Difference Items in set A but not in set B
# Symmetric difference Items not common


# Set comprehension 

# Use Set to store only immutable and hashable items
# int, float, string, tuple are allowed in a set
# List, dict, set are not allowed
```
