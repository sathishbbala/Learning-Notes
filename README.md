# Learning-Notes
This repository contains structured technical notes that I use as
refreshers while learning and revisiting core concepts across data,
cloud, and AI-related technologies.

The goal is clarity and long-term retention — not exhaustive coverage.

## Topics

- Python & data structures
- Databases - SQL, NoSQL, Distributed databases
- data architecture
- Cloud fundamentals [AWS]
- Vector databases & semantic search
- AI / ML concepts (from an architect’s perspective)

Notes are concise and written to reinforce understanding.
